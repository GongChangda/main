== PROJECT: docX

---

== Overview

docX is a desktop clinic data management application used to maintain clinic's database. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to find relevant and available doctors based on specialisation and available date and time*
** What it does: allows the user to find doctors who are relevant to the illness of the patient based on user's judgement, and those who are available at the desired date and time for an appointment.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now find available doctors that match with the required specialisation with just one line of command, instead of having to scroll through the list of doctors to find them manually.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required access to another class' information and temporary changes made to the model during implementation.
** Credits: originally done by siyingpoof.

* *Minor enhancement*: making searching of doctors by keywords more convenient with the usage of just 1 command.
